      "I generally donâ€™t write reviews but this deserves a thumbs up.  Stumbled upon this small cafe across from West End State School this morning.  Bought a flat white and some buns. They had cardamon and cinnamon buns and were the best Iâ€™ve had.  Buns were super soft, not too sweet with just the right amount of cinnamon / cardamon.  If youâ€™re looking for that craving, this is the place!  Have not tried the focaccia but will definitely give it a try.",

They were surprisingly filling too, just one sandwich made me full (I wanted to try a different oneðŸ˜¤)Will 200% come again and recommend to every friend of mine!!",

      "Itâ€™s great to see thereâ€™s new life making the most of this awesome west end space. While the kitchen occupies a large percentage of the space inside, it is open and conducive to good interaction between patrons and staff. â€˜Unfinishedâ€™ wouldnâ€™t be correct but I think the personality of the space is still growing. There is also soft natural light from the large street facing window, and outside boasts a functional little courtyard. The menu is all about the sandwiches, which are made to order and taste that way. Here: kimchi, lemon tahini and greens on focaccia. Kimchi and tahini, I wouldnâ€™t have thunk it, but this was throughly enjoyed, and certainly helped by the warm focaccia. You can tell they are passionate about the food, and the milk on the side of the smooth iced long black makes me think the same for their coffee.Overall, thoughtful food, and attentive and personal service. I hope to sus out the other sandwich flavours on return visits.",

      "The fresh focaccia that they make here is truly delicious. Iâ€™ve tried every sandwich currently on the menu and theyâ€™re all fantastic, they are generously loaded up with fresh herbs and all that good stuff. My personal favourite is the white bean sandwich. The coffee is good too. Have been recommending this place to just about everybody I know.",

      "Hands up best focaccia sandwiches Iâ€™ve had in my life. Every time I go they manage to surprise me and I now call it the orgasm sandwich place.Their sandwiches are super thought through, balanced, the ingredients complements each other in a very smart and delectable way and the textures are always on point.They change their menu pretty often and itâ€™s always new recipes coming from different parts of the globe. The care they put in their work really shows.To top it all, the service is great and the two owners are very friendly.Absolutely love that place !",
